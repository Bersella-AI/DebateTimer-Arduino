#Change log##Beta 6 (18 May, 2016)This is a major update. An extra requirement of (former) 16 bytes of internal EEPROM is added.> Space occupation: 13,298 bytes  Static allocation of memory: 719 bytes![Beta 6](http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/62fb934ajw1f3ttdchvmyj21kw0w0x3t.jpg)###New features***New key function: Settings***  * *"Settings"* can be accessed in Stage 12 (Audience Q&A) through "Screwdriver" (the central button).  * **Time limits and (firstly) speaking side of all the 11 stages can be configured.** Also, two options -- `Save and exit` and `Reset settings` is available. The number of stages still remains unchangeable, unfortunately.  * **Here shows how to configure a specified stage:**> 1. Switch to Stage 12, and press the "Screwdriver" button;2. Choose a stage, and press "Screwdriver" to configure;3. Switch which side should (firstly) speak in this stage. Press "Screwdriver" to confirm;4. Adjust the time limit of this stage, from 0 to 450 seconds (30s per step). "0" means disabling this stage. Press "Screwdriver" to confirm;5. Now this stage has been configured. Switch to a frame writing "Save and Exit!" and press "Screwdriver".6. All done!***Stores configuration after power off*** * The configuration is saved into the former 16 bytes of internal EEPROM, storing data after power off. When power on again, the latest configuration will be loaded. * The former 2 bytes of EEPROM are arranged for checksum `0x1477`. **If the checksum is incorrect, or the EEPROM has not used yet, OR "Reset settings" is confirmed in** ***Settings,*** **the system will load default settings.**  * **ONLY after "Save and exit" is confirmed**, would the new configuration be stored.***Supports "20 seconds" for the answering side in stages "Attack Defense"***  * In "Attack Defense" stages, *"Exchange"* will be shown when speaking.  * When the speech starts, only the timer of asking side will be shown. After pressing "Exchange", 20 seconds (or the overall time remaining if below 20s) will be given to the answering side. Press again, then the timer of answering side will be disabled.***Improved somewhere of code***  + Removed declarations never used yet;  + Adjusted the behavior of timers when pressing button(s). Now timers continue working until releasing button(s) pressed.  + (Made the button functions much more complex...)_\*Wrote this and Readme for 5 days...\*_##Beta 5 (27 Apr, 2016)This is a minor update. ONLY requires an extra button.> Space occupation: 10,424 bytes  Memory allocation: 685 bytes  * Enabled the LEFT button, to switch *backwards*.  * Adjusted the position of starting "beep"; the buzzer will beep after the welcome titles are shown. *But the issue in Beta 4 remains unsolved...*  * Moved the contents of welcome titles `START_TITLE` , only shown once in overall execution, from RAM to Flash; and read the contents from the Flash. This reduced the usage of RAM by 72 bytes (compared to Beta 4). A good experiment...## Beta 4 (20 Mar, 2016)###  -- with enhanced experience> Space occupation: 10,294 bytes  Memory allocation: 757 bytes  Digital pins required: 14 (8 PWM, 4 Analog In, a pair of I2C connectors)![Beta 4](http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/62fb934ajw1f24anqstlxj21kw0w01f6.jpg)***New features:***  + 2 RGB LEDs (Common-Anode type)  + A source-less buzzer module  + The third button (yet to be used), paired with a diode & a capacitor  + ...and *MORE* wiresThe LEDs and the buzzer provide a better experience to prompt the time keeper more intuitively:   * Once starting the speech, the light corresponding to current side will turn *green*;  * When the time remains just below 30 seconds, it turns *yellow*;  * When the time runs out, it turns *red*.  * The buzzer will *beep* in different frequency or period following the light turning.And *an "extra" stage* (Audience Q&A) is added, which don't need timers. Lights and the 8-digit display will be cleared when entering "extra" stages.***Known issues:***Through the test, I found the supply current via USB port increased to 240~260mA, double to Beta 3... And **when using USB power supply, the buzzer did not "stop"** -- playing a noise louder than "stopped" properly. I measured the buzzer's supply current when it's "stopped" -- 130mA! Probably there's problem with my buzzer...  To "stop" the buzzer properly and ensure the stability of the system, **a 9/12V DC adaptor** is recommended to power the system.*(Too busy to optimize...)*## Beta 3 (11 Mar, 2016)### -- the first available version![Beta 3](http://ww3.sinaimg.cn/large/62fb934ajw1f1ru985pt8j21kw0w07pp.jpg)I wrote the whole basic structure of the system on a piece of paper directly. And "translated" it into code once. And slightly adjusted the code 5 times. And it works!  In the interest of checking the availability of the basic structure, I minimized the hardware requirement to only 4 parts:  + LCD 2004 screen via I2C bus  + MAX7219-based 8-digit LED display  + 2 buttons  + A breadboard and wiresThe 8*8 LED matrix will no longer be used since this version. Other "required" hardware modules would be added in the next versions.  But, why not have a try?(⊙▽⊙)## Beta 1 & 2 (27 Dec & 29 Dec, 2015)Beta 1 aims to test the built-in timer and show a timer on the 8-digit display (reset to 0 when exceeding 999.9s).  Beta 2, adding a button on the base of Beta 1, is designed to test 2 timers using built-in functions `millis`, with a button to switch the timer to run.*(then 3 months passed unconsciously QAQ)*## Beta 0 (Test_MAX7219) (26 Dec, 2015)Just test an 8-digit display and an 8*8 LED matrix (both based on MAX7219).
